3D Solar System Simulation

A fully interactive 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js, featuring real-time orbital motion, camera rotation, zoom controls, and adjustable planetary speeds. The simulation includes all major planets, a glowing sun, orbit paths, and thousands of background stars.

Features

Realistic solar system layout with orbits
Dynamic lighting and starfield background
Hover tooltips for planets
Camera controls (drag to rotate, scroll to zoom)
Speed sliders to control each planet’s orbit speed
Pause/Play and Dark/Light theme toggle
